### How to buy CLSK tokens

Here are the steps to buy CLSK tokens. Make sure that you follow all the steps exactly.
You don't need to download any software to buy CLSK tokens; all the steps can be completed from within your browser.

1. Purchase LSK (Lisk) tokens on any major centralized cryptocurrency exchange of your choice. See available exchanges here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lisk/#Markets

2. Create a new LSK wallet on the Lisk blockchain using LDEX UI.
    - Open up the CLSK/LSK market in LDEX UI: https://ldex.trading/trade/#market=clsk/lsk
    - Click on the `Sign in` button near the top right of the screen.
    - Underneath the `Passphrase for LSK` text area, click on the `Generate wallet` button.
    - Copy the passphrase and keep it in a safe place. DO NOT LOSE IT. Make sure that you label it as 'LSK wallet' or similar so that you know which blockchain it's for.
    - Copy your new wallet address which starts with the letters `lsk`.
    - Keep this window and screen/modal open for later.

3. In a new browser window or tab, open your cryptocurrency exchange website, withdraw your LSK tokens into the on-chain wallet which you generated in step 2 above. Make sure you provide the correct wallet address as the withdrawal address.

4. Create a new CLSK wallet on the Capitalisk blockchain using LDEX UI:
    - Return to LDEX UI from step 2 with the `Sign in` screen/modal still open. Under the `Passphrase for CLSK` text area, click on the `Generate wallet` button.
    - Copy the passphrase and keep it in a safe place. DO NOT LOSE IT. Make sure that you label it as 'CLSK wallet' or similar so that you don't confuse it with your `LSK` wallet which you generated in step 2.
    - Click on the green `Submit` button. This will log you into both `LSK` and `CLSK` wallets at the same time.

5. Eventually, assuming that you completed step 3 correctly, you should see the balance of your `LSK` wallet (the one on the bottom left of LDEX UI) increase once your withdrawal has been processed. This typically takes a few minutes but it can take up to an hour depending on your exchange.

6. Once your `LSK` balance is visible inside LDEX UI, you can place a market order to purchase `CLSK` tokens. In the bottom-left, under the `BUY CLSK` section, just type in the amount of `LSK` you want to convert and click on the `Submit` button. This will create a market order which will convert your `LSK` tokens into `CLSK` for the best available price.

7. It can take 5 to 10 minutes for the trade to go through.

8. Once the trade is completed, your will be able to access your `CLSK` tokens by logging into the Capitalisk wallet here: https://capitalisk.com/wallet/ldpos/#/login - You should use the same passphrase as you generated in step 4.
