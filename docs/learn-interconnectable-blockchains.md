Capitalisk has a differentiated network topology. It was built with the idea of launching unlimited side-chains; independent economies that can be connected to one another. A node can take advantage and run multiple blockchains. Each chain will run in a separate process and will be scaled over multiple CPU cores. Nodes form an unstructured web of blockchains. E.g. Some nodes in the network can run both `capitalisk_chain` and `leasehold_chain`. Thus allowing a [cross-chain token swap](https://medium.com/@jonathangrosdubois/two-implementations-of-cross-chain-token-swaps-26a1e94b4f7c). Validator nodes have visibility over all chains across which they participate.

Unlike ETH, LDPoS was created to cater to communities and projects which value their sovereignty.
