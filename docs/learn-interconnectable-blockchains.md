Capitalisk has a differentiated network topology. It was built with the idea of launching unlimited side-chains; independent economies that can be connected to one another. A node can take advantage and run multiple blockchains. Each chain runs in a separate process and, in aggregate, they scale over multiple CPU cores and hosts; the architecture of the ecosystem is "embarrassingly parallel." Nodes form an unstructured web of blockchains and they can each optionally run multiple blockchains; thus allowing [cross-chain token swap](https://medium.com/@jonathangrosdubois/two-implementations-of-cross-chain-token-swaps-26a1e94b4f7c) functionality between those chains. Validator nodes have visibility over all chains across which they participate.

Unlike ETH, LDPoS was created to cater to communities and projects which value their sovereignty.
