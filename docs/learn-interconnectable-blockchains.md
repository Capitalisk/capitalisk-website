Capitalisk has a differentiated network topology. It was built with the idea to launch unlimited side-chains; independent economies that can be connected to one another. A node can take advantage and run multiple blockchains. Each chain will run in a separate environment and will be scaled over multiple processes and CPU cores. Nodes form an unstructured web of nodes and blockchains. E.g. node A can run `capitalisk_chain` and `leasehold_chain`. Thus allowing a [cross-chain token swap](https://medium.com/@jonathangrosdubois/two-implementations-of-cross-chain-token-swaps-26a1e94b4f7c). Validator nodes have total visibility over both chains.

Unlike ETH, LDPoS was created to incentivize independent communities and projects to integrate and instead of relying on a token that provides the tools, but not full autonomy.
