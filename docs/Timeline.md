## ITO & IEO

Leasehold Token (LSH) is a truly deflationary token that is backed by powerful technology that can be used to tokenize assets such as real estate, therefore creating cryptographic tokens linked to the underlying asset and which can be listed and traded on an existing DEX. LSH should therefore be viewed as a base currency which the token holder happens to share with Leasehold Holdings (Pty) Ltd and not as a security token which represents a share of the business itself.
