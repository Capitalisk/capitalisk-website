Capitalisk was founded out of a need to create interconnectable blockchains and to give communities the ability to easily setup decentralized markets between them. Blockchains in the Capitalisk ecosystem can be fully isolated from each other. The goal is to give developers an incentive to build great project, launch their own dedicated token and integrate it within our ecosystem.

## Philosophy

The Capitalisk blockchain ideology is about giving you the incentive to focus on your product and launch it within the Capitalisk ecosystem. Unlike ETH, where fees are unavoidably high; Capitalisk enables you to launch your token on a separate blockchain which is only loosely connected to the Capitalisk mainchain. Communities will have full control of their ecosystems. Capitalisk merely provides the tools to do so. We strongly believe in democratized chains and markets.

## LDEX

LDEX was founded to trade between tokens. A market can be [launched](/docs/launch-custom-dex-market) in a matter of minutes if it's based of the [`ldpos-chain`](https://github.com/Capitalisk/ldpos-chain) module.
