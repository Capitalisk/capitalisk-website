Capitalisk was founded by the desire to create interconnectable chains and give the ability to easily setup interoperable markets and blockchains and have an adhocratic ecosystem. Although chains can be ran completely isolated. The incentive is that developers build great things, launch their own dedicated token and integrate with our ecosystem.

## Philosophy

The Capitalisk blockchain ideology is giving the incentive to focus on your product and launch it within the Capitalisk ecosystem. Unlike ETH, where fees are inherently expensive; Capitalisk incentivizes to launch custom tokens. Products will have full control of their ecosystems. Capitalisk merely provides the tools to do so. We strongly believe democratized chains and markets.

## LDEX

LDEX was founded to trade between tokens. A market can be [launched](/docs/launch-custom-dex-market) in a matter of minutes if it's based of the [`ldpos-chain`](https://github.com/Capitalisk/ldpos-chain) module.
